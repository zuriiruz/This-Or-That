## THIS OR THAT
Team Members: Zuri, Camille, Sophie
Category: Game Development

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT (2-3 sentences)
    
    The problem we are solving is decision fatigue. Both teens and young adults are more likely to experience struggle making decisions when comparing many options at once.  

2. SOLUTION (3-4 sentences)
    
    This or That is a small text-based game that lessens decision fatigue by asking the user to list all options. It then presents two options at a time and asks the user to choose one until the program runs through every comparison and can create a ranking. Our core features are the ability to make customized lists, save those rankings in a file, and an advanced sorting system that ranks options based on list subject (to-do list/numbered ranking/etc.). 

3. TARGET MARKET (1-2 sentences)
    
    Our product will be used primarily by teens and young adults. We estimate a potential user count of 20-100.

4. WHY IT'S VALUABLE (1-2 sentences)
    
    The root of the benefits of our product is time optimization and subsequent ly,stress relief.  By relieving the time and brainpower needed to make a decision, this optimizes the amount of time needed to act on the task/decision at hand.
