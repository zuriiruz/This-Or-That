## THIS OR THAT
Team Members: Zuri, Camille, Sophie
Category: Game Development

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT (2-3 sentences)
    
    The problem we are solving is decision fatigue. Both teens and young adults are more likely to experience struggle making decisions when comparing many options at once.  

2. SOLUTION (3-4 sentences)
    
    This or That is a small text-based game that lessens decision fatigue by asking the user to list all options. It then presents two options at a time and asks the user to choose one until the program runs through every comparison and can create a ranking. Our core features are the ability to make customized lists, save those rankings in a file, and an advanced sorting system that ranks options based on list subject (to-do list/numbered ranking/etc.). 

3. TARGET MARKET (1-2 sentences)
    
    Our product will be used primarily by teens and young adults. We estimate a potential user count of 20-100.

4. WHY IT'S VALUABLE (1-2 sentences)
    
    The root of the benefits of our product is time optimization and subsequently, stress relief.  By relieving the time and brainpower needed to make a decision, this optimizes the amount of time needed to act on the task/decision at hand.

5. HOW YOU'LL MAKE MONEY (1-2 sentences)

   The game would require a one-time purchase of $3.99 to be made in order to access the entire game. Once the game expands to a larger player base, new content would be added with an additional one-time purchase of $1.99. 

6. MVP FEATURES (Bulleted list)

   - Customized lists made by the user 
   - Ability to save rankings/results into a local file
   - Advanced ranking system that acknowledges the subject of the list and prioritizes quick decision-making skills with a timer
   - Show statistics/analytics and choose a personality type for the user based on decision making

7. TIMELINE & DIVISION OF WORK (REQUIRED - NOT OPTIONAL)

   Week 1: Zuri – Task: conducting market research and working on the proposal | Camille – Task: implementing the RankingAlgorithm and RankingGame classes | Sophie – Task: implementing Junit class and Option/Main class. 
   
   Week 2: Zuri – Task: Reviewing code and prioritizing customer features | Camille – Task: Debugging code/adding visuals | Sophie  - Task: final testing of program

8. TEAM ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES (REQUIRED - NOT OPTIONAL)

   Zuri – Product Owner + Business Analyst 
   - Writing proposal
   - Prioritize customer-valued features and consider monetization and market opportunities for the product
   - Estimated % of codebase: 20%

   Sophie – Documentation Lead + Tester
   - Implementing Junit tests into the code/testing edge cases to ensure that program works properly
   - Leaving comments in code for others to build on
   - Researching coding methods/tutorials when encountering issues. 
   - Estimated % of codebase: 35%

   Camille – Lead Developer
   - Developing the ranking system and game controller
   - Code review/debugging
   - Estimated % of codebase: 45%

9. VIABILITY: HOW WE'LL PROVE THIS WORKS (REQUIRED - NOT OPTIONAL)
   How will you validate that real users want this?
   - User testing plan (who, when, how many)
   - Competitive analysis (what exists now, why ours is better)
   - Market research sources (prove your market exists)
   - Success metrics (what proves viability?)
  
     We ran a survey that was given out to around 20 people within our target audience's age range, with the majority of responses confirming that decision fatigue is a common issue amongst teenagers and young adults, and that a game that's purpose was to guide the user in making decisions would help with decision fatigue. Through research, it's proven that not only is pairwise comparison a common testing strategy, but is already a large part of young adult spaces such as fandom, where others create websites made to rank various things like characters through pairwise comparison. This or That stands out against these because it allows the user to create a custom ranking list and input any options compared to websites which are restricted to a specific set of options made by the creator, allowing ordinary people who don't have the knowledge to make their own ranking algorithm to have access to easy pairwise comparison. 

10. SCALABILITY: ROADMAP FROM MVP TO 100K USERS (REQUIRED - NOT OPTIONAL)
    Phase 1 (Now): MVP with 20 users and the base game, $2.99 one time purchase to access custom rankings. 
    Phase 2 (6 months): Expand to 50k users, create an app game with clean visuals that draws in attention from potential users and an account system. One time $4.99
    Phase 3 (12 months): Scale to 100k users, add image export and public ranking lists, turn the app into a social tool and allow users to access and share old rankings. Convert app to a freemium model where base rankings are free, but a premium plan of $4.99/month allows the user to rank unlimited items, use custom themes in rankings, and be able to publish their rankings to a community page. 


11. SOURCES & REFERENCES (REQUIRED - NOT OPTIONAL)
    List all sources for market claims, competitive analysis, and research
    - Source 1: https://www.userresearchstrategist.com/p/a-guide-to-pairwise-comparison 
    - Source 2: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266398023_Gamification_in_Theory_and_Action_A_Survey
    - Interviews: Ran a survey asking friends aged teenagers to young adults asking whether they had interest in the game and what they would pay.
