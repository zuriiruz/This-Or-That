## THIS OR THAT
Team Members: Zuri, Camille, Sophie
Category: Game Development

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT (2-3 sentences)
    
    The problem we are solving is decision fatigue. Both teens and young adults are more likely to experience struggle making decisions when comparing many options at once.  

2. SOLUTION (3-4 sentences)
    
    This or That is a small text-based game that lessens decision fatigue by asking the user to list all options. It then presents two options at a time and asks the user to choose one until the program runs through every comparison and can create a ranking. Our core features are the ability to make customized lists, save those rankings in a file, and an advanced sorting system that ranks options based on list subject (to-do list/numbered ranking/etc.). 

3. TARGET MARKET (1-2 sentences)
    
    Our product will be used primarily by teens and young adults. We estimate a potential user count of 20-100.

4. WHY IT'S VALUABLE (1-2 sentences)
    
    The root of the benefits of our product is time optimization and subsequently, stress relief.  By relieving the time and brainpower needed to make a decision, this optimizes the amount of time needed to act on the task/decision at hand.

5. HOW YOU'LL MAKE MONEY (1-2 sentences)

   The game would require a one-time purchase of $3.99 to be made in order to access the entire game. Once the game expands to a larger player base, new content would be added with an additional one-time purchase of $1.99. 

6. MVP FEATURES (Bulleted list)

   - Customized lists made by the user 
   - Ability to save rankings/results into a local file
   - Advanced ranking system that acknowledges the subject of the list and prioritizes quick decision-making skills with a timer
   - Show statistics/analytics and choose a personality type for the user based on decision making
